# Workflow Overview

## The 5-Stage AI Production Pipeline

This pipeline represents a human-centered approach to AI-assisted creative production, designed for agency environments where quality, consistency, and creative direction are paramount.

---

## Stage 1: Brief Analysis & Conceptual Direction

**Duration:** 1-3 hours (small project) | 1-2 days (medium) | 3-5 days (large)

**Key Activities:**
- Client brief deconstruction
- Visual references gathering
- Style & mood exploration
- Technical requirements mapping
- Tool selection strategy

**Human Decision Points:**
- Creative direction definition
- Visual language selection
- Brand alignment verification
- Feasibility assessment

**Outputs:**
- Creative brief document
- Reference mood board
- Technical specifications
- Tool selection rationale

---

## Stage 2: Visual Exploration & Iteration

**Duration:** 4-8 hours (small) | 2-5 days (medium) | 1-2 weeks (large)

**Key Activities:**
- Initial prompt engineering
- Style testing across platforms
- Composition experimentation
- Feedback loops with stakeholders
- Direction refinement

**Tools Selection:**
- **Midjourney:** Artistic exploration, stylized content
- **Firefly:** Brand-safe commercial work
- **ComfyUI:** Precise control, batch production

**Human Decision Points:**
- Style approval
- Composition selection
- Brand consistency check
- Iteration direction

**Outputs:**
- Multiple visual directions (3-5 options)
- Selected style framework
- Prompt library
- Iteration documentation

---

## Stage 3: Controlled Generation

**Duration:** 2-6 hours (small) | 3-7 days (medium) | 2-4 weeks (large)

**Key Activities:**
- Production prompt optimization
- Batch generation workflows
- Consistency maintenance
- Quality control screening
- Asset organization

**Quality Standards:**
- Technical compliance (resolution, format)
- Brand guideline adherence
- Visual consistency across set
- Commercial usage rights verification

**Human Decision Points:**
- Generation parameter tuning
- Output quality approval
- Consistency assessment
- Production pivot decisions

**Outputs:**
- Generated asset library
- Selected candidates for post-production
- Generation metadata
- Quality control reports

---

## Stage 4: Selection & Post-Production

**Duration:** 2-4 hours (small) | 2-5 days (medium) | 1-3 weeks (large)

**Key Activities:**
- Final asset selection
- Professional retouching (Photoshop/After Effects)
- Composition adjustments
- Text/branding integration
- Format adaptation (web, print, social)

**Traditional Tools Integration:**
- Adobe Photoshop (retouching, compositing)
- Adobe Illustrator (vector elements)
- After Effects (motion graphics)
- Premiere Pro (video assembly)

**Human Decision Points:**
- Final asset curation
- Retouching extent
- Brand integration approval
- Output format optimization

**Outputs:**
- Finalized production-ready assets
- Multiple format variations
- Source files for future edits
- Asset metadata & usage notes

---

## Stage 5: Delivery & Documentation

**Duration:** 1-2 hours (small) | 1 day (medium) | 2-3 days (large)

**Key Activities:**
- File organization & naming
- Delivery package assembly
- Usage rights documentation
- Process documentation
- Client handoff

**Deliverables Structure:**
```
project-name/
├── finals/           # Production-ready assets
├── alternates/       # Approved variations
├── sources/          # Editable files
├── references/       # Original prompts & settings
└── documentation/    # Process notes, usage rights
```

**Documentation Includes:**
- Asset usage guidelines
- Regeneration instructions (prompts & settings)
- Licensing & rights information
- Technical specifications
- Workflow notes for future iterations

## Key Principles

### 1. Human-in-the-Loop Always
AI generates options; humans make creative decisions. Every stage requires professional judgment.

### 2. Tool Selection by Context
Different tools for different needs:
- **Speed:** Midjourney
- **Safety:** Firefly  
- **Control:** ComfyUI

### 3. Iterative Refinement
Expect 3-5 major iterations per project. Build time for exploration and pivots.

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
Generate many options, curate ruthlessly. 100 generations → 20 candidates → 5 finals.

### 5. Traditional Skills Integration
AI augments, doesn't replace. Professional post-production is essential for agency-quality output.

### 6. Documentation as Deliverable
Process transparency builds client trust and enables future iterations.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Skipping human exploration phase** → Generic AI aesthetics  
❌ **Over-reliance on single tool** → Limited creative solutions  
❌ **Insufficient post-production** → Amateur-looking finals  
❌ **Poor documentation** → Unrepeatable results  
❌ **Ignoring licensing** → Legal vulnerabilities  

✅ Use this pipeline as a framework, adapt to project needs  
✅ Invest time in Stage 1 & 2 for better Stage 3 results  
✅ Maintain traditional production standards throughout

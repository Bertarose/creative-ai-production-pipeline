## Use Case 1: Client Pitch Deck Visuals

**Context:**  
A boutique agency is pitching a sustainable fashion brand. They need compelling hero visuals for a presentation deck, but the budget doesn't allow for a photoshoot.

**Challenge:**
- 48-72 hour turnaround
- No budget for photography/illustration
- Need to convey luxury + sustainability
- Must align with client's existing brand aesthetic

**Pipeline Application:**

**Stage 1 (4 hours):**
- Analyze client's brand guidelines and Instagram feed
- Identify visual language: organic textures, earth tones, minimalist composition
- Select Midjourney for artistic quality + Firefly for any brand-specific elements

**Stage 2 (12 hours):**
- Generate 50+ style explorations in Midjourney
- Test prompts: "sustainable luxury fashion, organic cotton texture, earth tones, minimalist studio photography --ar 16:9 --v 6"
- Iterate based on account director feedback
- Narrow to 3 distinct visual directions

**Stage 3 (8 hours):**
- Produce 20 finals per direction (60 total images)
- Maintain consistency with locked-in prompt structure + seed values

**Stage 4 (6 hours):**
- Select 8 hero images for deck
- Minor retouching in Photoshop (remove artifacts, color grading)
- Integrate with pitch deck layout

**Stage 5 (2 hours):**
- Package finals + source prompts
- Document regeneration process for potential future use

**Outcome:**
- Pitch deck completed in 32 hours
- Client wins the account
- Visuals become foundation for actual campaign concepts

**Business Value:**
- Enabled pitch participation despite tight timeline
- Cost: ~$150 (tool subscriptions) vs $5,000+ for custom illustration
- Demonstrated creative range and speed to client

- Test consistency across different subjects
- Stress-test with real project scenarios

**Stage 4 (1 week):**
- Professional post-production to refine signature looks
- Create before/after examples showing enhancement process
- Develop style guides with technical specifications

**Stage 5 (1 week):**
- Package as internal IP
- Create training materials for team
- Develop client-facing case studies

**Outcome:**
- 4 proprietary visual styles developed
- Team upskilled in advanced AI techniques
- New service offerings for clients

**Business Value:**
- Competitive differentiation in RFP responses
- Higher-value service tier for clients

- 3 markets with localization needs
- 2-week timeline
- Consistency across all assets crucial

**Pipeline Application:**

**Stage 1 (3 days):**
- Comprehensive brief breakdown
- Visual system design (color, composition, motifs)
- Technical specification mapping
- Tool selection: ComfyUI for batch control

**Stage 2 (4 days):**
- Style locking with reference images
- Prompt template development with variables
- Test batch generations
- Stakeholder alignment on direction

**Stage 3 (3 days):**
- ComfyUI batch workflow setup
- Generate base compositions (100+ images)
- Quality control filtering
- Organize by market/platform

**Stage 4 (3 days):**
- Parallel post-production by 3 designers
- Platform-specific adaptations
- Text/logo integration
- Format exports (9:16, 1:1, 16:9, etc.)

**Stage 5 (1 day):**
- DAM system upload with metadata
- Delivery to client with usage guidelines
- Handoff documentation for future batches

**Outcome:**
- 52 unique base compositions → 156 final formatted assets
- Delivered on time with budget to spare
- Visual consistency maintained across entire set

**Business Value:**
- Traditional production would cost $25,000-40,000
- AI pipeline cost: ~$8,000 (team time + tools)
- Client retained for next quarter's campaign

## Use Case 4: Educational Content Illustration

**Context:**  
An agency produces e-learning content for a healthcare client. They need custom illustrations for 20 training modules, but illustration budget is limited.

**Challenge:**
- Medical accuracy required
- Must align with existing course visual style
- Need cultural diversity in character representation
- Copyright must be completely clear

**Pipeline Application:**

**Stage 1 (2 days):**
- Review existing course materials
- Consult with client's medical advisor
- Tool selection: Adobe Firefly (commercial-safe training data)

**Stage 2 (3 days):**
- Character design with diversity requirements
- Medical scenario compositions
- Iterate with medical advisor for accuracy
- Lock in approved style

**Stage 3 (4 days):**

## When This Pipeline Works Best

✅ **High-volume needs** (10+ assets)  
✅ **Tight timelines** (<2 weeks)  
✅ **Budget constraints** (< $10k production budget)  
✅ **Conceptual exploration** (pitch phase, R&D)  
✅ **Digital-first delivery** (web, social, presentations)  

⚠️ **Less suitable for:**
- Ultra-premium print campaigns requiring bespoke photography
- Projects where specific real people/products must be depicted
- Contexts where AI usage would alienate the target audience

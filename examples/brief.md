## Visual Direction

### Approved Mood

**Primary Aesthetic:** "Intelligent Optimism"
- Sophisticated but not cold
- Tech-forward but human-centered
- Data-rich but not overwhelming
- Green without being cliché

**Reference Inspirations:**
- Apple's product photography (clean, premium, approachable)
- Data visualization from The Pudding (playful, clear, engaging)
- Patagonia's brand tone (authentic, mission-driven, not preachy)

### Color Palette

**Primary:**
- Forest Green: #1B4332 (authority, nature)
- Sage Green: #52B788 (growth, optimism)

**Secondary:**
- Charcoal: #2D3142 (sophistication)
- Cream: #EFF6EE (breathability, cleanliness)

**Accent:**
- Electric Blue: #4361EE (technology, trust)
- Coral: #F4845F (energy, human touch)

**Usage Notes:**
- Green as primary brand color but NOT dominant in every asset
- Use charcoal/cream for 60% of palette to avoid green overload
- Blue/coral as strategic highlights

### Imagery Guidelines

**DO:**
- Abstract representations of data flowing through natural forms
- Geometric patterns that suggest organization + growth
- Close-ups of technology integrated with organic elements
- Diverse hands interacting with clean interfaces
- Atmospheric shots of modern sustainable architecture

**DO NOT:**
- Generic stock photos of business people shaking hands
- Overused imagery: hands holding plants, generic solar panels, polar bears
- Anything that feels "corporate sustainability theater"
- Heavy illustration style (keep it photography-based)

### Typography Style
(For reference when adding text in post-production)

**Headings:** Inter Bold (modern, tech-appropriate, excellent web rendering)
**Body:** Inter Regular
**Data/Stats:** Space Mono (monospace for technical credibility)

## Constraints & Considerations

### What We Have:

  - **Mitigation:** Lock seeds and prompts early, generate in batches
- **Risk:** Green clichés creeping in
  - **Mitigation:** Weekly gut-check with team, client check-ins
